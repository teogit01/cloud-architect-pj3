# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Set a rule to limit access to instance by ssh, remove any external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
VPC private endpoints alone would not protect the secrets bucket from unwanted access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Yes, it will affect both new objects uploaded to the bucket as well as objects that already exist in the bucket.


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All of the changes we made to the initial cloudformation setup directly through the AWS administration dashboard will be undone.
