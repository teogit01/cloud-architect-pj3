Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The vulnerabilities.

1. The IAM policy violates the concept of least privilege by granting full access to resources.
2. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
3. There is no HTTP->HTTPS redirection in the Loadbalancer.
4. VPC Security Groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which is against AWS' guideline.
5. On the EC2 instance, TCP port 5000 is accessible from the internet.

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Set IAM policies to prevent root users from gaining access and to enforce MFA, as well as specified permissions.
2. Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3.
3. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
4. Only allow 80 and 443 in the Security Groups, and refer to the other security group for accessing AWS resources within the VPC.
5. On the EC2 instance, disable all non-essential ports
