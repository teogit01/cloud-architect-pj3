Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Public subnet will allow all connection to access.

# Poor practice 2
Privelege business user should not directly access S3, instead we should set IAM role for user to access S3

# Poor practice 3
Should use https for security instead of http
